In most countries, vehicle number plates are used for identifying cars and other automobiles. The task is either performed manually or automatically in some nations. Automated vehicle number plate recognition is a system to identify different automobiles by the unique number plate allotted to them. The automated system is used for easy and faster traffic control and security applications such as border control and tracking of suspicious vehicles. The Number Plate Recognition (NPR) is considered to be the best method for identifying vehicles. But a challenge for applying it in India is that no particular standard is available regulating vehicle number plates. The plates come in various sizes, colors, and ratios. Also, identification with different intensities of light is a big challenge. 
This project uses MATLAB to identify different automobiles through numberplates using OCR(Optical Character Recognition).
